Problem Statement:

The major goal of this project is to improve the delivery of citizen services in the
village by computerizing applications for gram panchayat services. Gram
panchayat is a decentralized institution that manages applications and provides
information about gram panchayat services. The suggested system will allow users
to submit applications for various services and track their progress. The suggested
system E-Services for Gram Panchayath develops a web application with the goal
of providing government information about services or schemes, and public users
can apply for services using an online application. Admin and staff will manage the
application for approval and creation of the scheme.
